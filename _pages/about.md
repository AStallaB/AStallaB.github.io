Welcome to my website! I am a senior economist in the International Policy Analysis Division of the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html). I hold a PhD in Finance from [Universite Paris Dauphine-PSL](https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/).  Previous to that, I worked 3 years at the Financial Stability Directorate of [Banque de France](https://www.banque-france.fr/en) and 3 years in the International Macroeconomics Division of the same institution. I specialize in macro-financial research, with an emphasize on equity and commodity markets, financial contagion, economic forecasting and time series econometrics.
