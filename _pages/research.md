## Structural Estimation of Time-Varying Spillovers: an Application to International Credit Risk Transmission
<span style="color:grey">With Lukas Boeckelmann</span> \
<span style="color:grey">Working Paper Banque de France (2021) </span>  \
We propose a novel approach to quantify spillovers on financial markets based on a structural version of the Diebold-Yilmaz framework. Key to our approach is a SVAR-GARCH model that is statistically identified by heteroskedasticity, economically identified by maximum shock contribution and that allows for time-varying forecast error variance decompositions. We analyze credit risk spillovers between EZ sovereign and bank CDS. Methodologically, we find the model to better match economic narratives compared with common spillover approaches and to be more reactive than models relying on rolling window estimations. We find, on average, spillovers to explain 37&#37; of the variation in our sample, amid a strong variation of the latter over time. \

## Stock Return Predictability: comparing Macro- and Micro-Approaches
Economic theory identifies two potential sources of return predictability: time variation in expected returns (beta-predictability) or market inefficiencies (alpha-predictability). For the latter, Samuelson argued that macro-returns exhibit more inefficiencies than micro-returns, as individual stories are averaged out, leaving only harder-to-eliminate macro-mispricing at the index-level. To evaluate this claim, we compare macro- and micro-predictability on US data to gauge if the former turns out higher than the latter. Additionally, we extend over time the methodology of Rapach et al. (2011) to disentangle the two sources of predictability. We first  find that Samuelson's view appears incorrect, as micro-predictability is not structurally lower than macro-predictability. Second, we find that our estimated alpha- and beta-predictability indices are coherent with their corresponding theoretical implications, thus suggesting that the two mechanisms are at play in our dataset. Notably, the alpha-predictability index appears as a theoretically based and easily updatable metric to spot irrational exuberance.\

## What are the factors behind current high stock market valuations?
<span style="color:grey">With Nicolas Chatelais</span> \

Despite the corrections at the end of 2018 and the Covid-19 shock, price-earnings ratios remain at high levels, particularly in the United States. However, based on indices adjusted for expected growth and the level of interest rates, this trend does not appear to be the result of irrational exuberance like in previous speculative episodes. \

## Environmental Score and Stock Valuation
<span style="color:grey">With Tristan Jourde</span> \
Following recent financial stability concerns about the emergence of a green bubble, this paper proposes to examine the valuation of green and brown stocks. We classify green and brown stocks based on environmental scores (?E? of ESG). We use three valuation measures, namely price-earnings ratios (trailing and forward) and the equity risk premium. Our dataset covers over 2,500 companies internationally from 2017 to 2021. Our main results are based on panel regressions, in which we control for other characteristics that could also affect valuation, such as firm size, investment policy, leverage, sectors and countries. In sharp contrast to the green bubble narrative, our findings show that green stocks are significantly cheaper than brown stocks. We argue that the discount of green stocks can be explained either by the fact that a high environmental score may be a sign of low future profitability or by the fact that investors' environmental consciousness (and awareness of climate risks) remains low. 


## Interpreting Market Perception of Sovereign Risk Using Machine Learning Techniques
<span style="color:grey">With Guillaume Belly, Lukas Boeckelmann, Carlos Mareo Caicedo Graciano, Alberto Di Iorio , Klodiana Istrefi and Vasileios Siakoulis</span> \
This paper is disclosing some investigations on the use of Machine Leaning techniques applied to sovereign risk assessment and related pricing. In details, a  two-fold focus has been made on enhancing the predictive accuracy of sovereign spreads in the euro area as well as the interpretability of the various economic factor contributions by the markets. ML techniques have captured the dynamics in the market - estimate of sovereign risk in a far more efficient way than traditional econometric models, both in a cross section[1] and time series behavior. Concerning model interpretability,  these investigations have confirmed that macroeconomic and global financial factors affect sovereign risk assessment and the creation of the corresponding  sovereign spreads. In addition, it has been highlighted that public appreciation  on financial news, redenomination fears and the central banker?s policy preference expressed by the degree of hawkishness or dovishness in policy maker?s speeches, prevail on  on sovereign spreads estimation.
